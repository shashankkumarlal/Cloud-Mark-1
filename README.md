# Cloud-Mark-1

PROJECT IDEA : AI-Enabled Smart Assistant for the Visually Impaired

OBJECTIVE:
Develop an obstacle-detection system that notifies blind users via a mobile phone. Notifications are sent to the cloud and read out loud on the phone as real-time alerts like "Careful, object ahead" or "Careful, human ahead."

AI Component for Obstacle Detection:
We'll be using a Decision Tree Classifier or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, both of which are easy to implement and are effective for small datasets. These models will classify the obstacle type (e.g., human, object, no obstacle) based on data from your ultrasonic and IR sensors.

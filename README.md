# PROJECT IDEA :CLOUD OPTIGUARD [Intelligent Cost Optimization and Performance Monitoring System for Cloud Workloads]

#Problem Statement
Many companies using cloud services struggle with optimizing their cloud costs and monitoring performance efficiently. They often face challenges such as:

Over-provisioning or under-utilization of cloud resources, leading to excessive costs.
Performance bottlenecks that degrade user experience.
Lack of real-time alerts for inefficient resources.
Manual intervention required to analyze and optimize cloud infrastructure.
# AI Component for Obstacle Detection:
We'll be using a Decision Tree Classifier or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, both of which are easy to implement and are effective for small datasets. These models will classify the obstacle type (e.g., human, object, no obstacle) based on data from your ultrasonic and IR sensors.

#STEP 1: Choosing a cloud platform : AWS
Why AWS is the Best Choice for CloudOptiGuard?
✔ Most widely used by cloud consulting firms like Accenture, Deloitte, TCS, and Wipro.
✔ Best cost tracking tools (AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets) to analyze billing data.
✔ Powerful auto-scaling (AWS Auto Scaling, EC2 Spot Instances) for cost optimization.
✔ AWS CloudWatch provides real-time monitoring & logs, making it easy to detect performance issues.
✔ Good ML integration with AWS Lambda & Amazon SageMaker for predictive analytics.

# Cloud-Mark-1

PROJECT IDEA : AI-Enabled Smart Assistant for the Visually Impaired

OBJECTIVE:
Develop an obstacle-detection system that notifies blind users via a mobile phone. Notifications are sent to the cloud and read out loud on the phone as real-time alerts like "Careful, object ahead" or "Careful, human ahead."

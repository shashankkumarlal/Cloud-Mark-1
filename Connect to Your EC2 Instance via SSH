AFTER MAKING INSTANCE IN EC2 AND COFIGURING CLOUDWATCH ->
#CONNECTION TO YOUR EC2 INSTACE VIA SSH

1️⃣ Exit your EC2 instance
Since you're inside the instance , first exit it:
->exit
2️⃣ Check if the key exists on your local machine
On your local terminal (not inside EC2), run:
->ls -l CloudOptiGuard-Key.pem
If it exists, note the correct file path.
3️⃣ Use the correct file path for SSH
If your key file is in Downloads, for example, try:
->ssh -i ~/Downloads/CloudOptiGuard-Key.pem ubuntu@54.227.116.54
If it's somewhere else, replace ~/Downloads/CloudOptiGuard-Key.pem with the actual path.
4️⃣ If you lost the key file

You cannot recover it from AWS.
You'll need to create a new key pair, update your EC2 instance’s key, and try again.

Try connecting using full path 
->ssh -i ~/-...your_path....-Key.pem ubuntu@54.227.1....

If you get a permissions error, run this command first:
->chmod 400 ~/...your_path....-Key.pem-Key.pem
then try SSH again 

1.amazonaws.com
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? TYPE "YES"

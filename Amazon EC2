#Step 4: Open EC2 Dashboard
In the AWS Management Console, search for EC2 in the top search bar.
Click on EC2 to open the dashboard.
Start Creating an Instance
Click on "Launch instance" (big orange button).
You'll see a screen titled "Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)".
Choose a Name for Your Instance
At the top, you'll see a text box for "Name and tags".
Enter a name for your instance. You can name it CloudOptiGuard-Test or anything you like.
Choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
Scroll down to the ‚ÄúApplication and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)‚Äù section.
Select ‚ÄúAmazon Linux 2023‚Äù (it should be in the "Quick Start" list).
This is a free-tier eligible Linux-based OS, perfect for testing.
Keep the x86_64 architecture selected.
Choose an Instance Type
Scroll down to the ‚ÄúInstance Type‚Äù section.
Select t2.micro (it should be the default).
‚úÖ It‚Äôs free-tier eligible and has 1 vCPU and 1 GB RAM, which is enough for testing.
üîπ Do NOT change anything else here.
Configure Key Pair for SSH Access
Now, we need to set up a key pair so we can securely connect to the instance later.

Scroll down to "Key pair (login)" section.
Click "Create new key pair" (if you don‚Äôt have one already).
Set these details:
Key pair name ‚Üí CloudOptiGuard-Key
Key pair type ‚Üí RSA (default)
Private key format ‚Üí .pem (important for SSH access)
Click "Create key pair" ‚Üí It will download a .pem file.
Keep this file safe (you will need it to SSH into the instance).
Configure Network Settings
Now, we need to set up network access so we can connect to the instance.

Scroll down to "Network settings" section.
Make sure "Allow SSH traffic from" is enabled:
Choose "Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)" (This allows SSH access from any IP).
‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note: If this is a test instance, it's fine. But for production, restrict access to your own IP.
Click "Edit" under "Security group" and check if there is a rule for:
SSH (Port 22) ‚Üí Allowed from Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
HTTP (Port 80) ‚Üí (If we need a web server later)
HTTPS (Port 443) ‚Üí (For secure web traffic)
LAUNCH INSTANCE
